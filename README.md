Twitwi
===========

My own static page generator based on Twig and Html5Boilerplate

## [Not Invented Here][1]

That's right, like Sculpin or Phrozn. 

But I did not want a multi-paradigm, multi-user, multi-plateform static pages
generator with multiple languages and multiple configurations.

All I want is a generator "a-la-copy-paste" based on things I already know :
 * Twig
 * Twitter bootstrap

(hence the name)
