Twitwi
===========

My own static page generator based on Twig

## Not Invented Here

That's right, like Sculpin or Phrozn, but I did not want a multi-paradigm, multi-user, multi-plateform static pages
generator with multiple languages and multiple configurations.

All I want is a copy-paste generator based on things I already know :
 * Twig
 * Twitter bootstrap

(hence the name)
