Twitwi
===========

My own static page generator based on [Twig][2] and [Html5 Boilerplate][3]

## [Not Invented Here][1]

That's right, like [Sculpin][5] or [Phrozn][4].

But I did not want a multi-paradigm, multi-user, multi-plateform static pages
generator with multiple languages and multiple configurations.

All I want is a generator "a-la-copy-paste" based on things I already know :
 * Twig
 * [Twitter bootstrap][6]

(hence the fancy name)
